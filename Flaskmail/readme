Requirements
=============
This program requires the installation of 'Flask' and 'flask-mail' packages.
It has been tested using Flask 0.10.1 and flask-mail 0.9.1.

If you are using Gmail, the first time this program is run, the user will need to login to Gmail and check if Gmail has an alert for sending automated
messages through it. By default, Gmail does not allow machines to send messages through it. This security feature will need to be disabled for this feature to work.

Variables needed to be configured
==================================
<Gmail id without the @gmail.com extension>
<Password of Gmail id>
<Sender Gmail id>
<Receiver Gmail id>

Format of replacing above variables is to replace everything including <> with the appropriate string.
